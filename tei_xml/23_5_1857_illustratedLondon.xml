         <p><s>The Bengal papers are filled with the particulars of the mutiny of the 19th Regiment
               Native Infantry, which has ended in the disbandment of that corps, and the spread of
               disaffection to the 34th Regiment Native Infantry.</s>
            <s>The original pretence of the mutineers was that they were supplied with cartridges in
               the manufacture of which some animal impurity was used that it would defile a Brahmin
               to touch.</s>
            <s>The fact turns out to be that it is the old story of a demand for an increase of
               pay.</s></p>
         <p><s>A Calcutta correspondent gives the following graphic account of the disbandment of
               the disaffected regiment:&#8212;</s></p>
         <div>
            <p><s>The 19th Regiment Native Infantry has been disbanded.</s>
               <s>The Government ordered it to march to <location source="1277100">
                     <geogName>Barrackpore</geogName>
                  </location>, the metropolitan cantonment, in order that the punishment might be
                  inflicted in the presence of the disaffected.</s>
               <s>Meanwhile every precaution was adopted to prevent the possiblity of
                  resistance.</s>
               <s>It was known that the 34th were in league with the 19th.</s>
               <s>It was suspected that the 2nd Grenadiers, if not positively disaffected, were
                  cognisant of the plans, and sympathised with the mutinous regiment.</s>
               <s>The two remaining native corps of the brigade were believe to be faithful, but it
                  is never easy to predict what natives will do when a temptation is placed suddenly
                  before them.</s>
               <s>It was, therefore, necessary to provide against an outbreak of five thousand armed
                  men stationed only sixteen miles from a <location source="1275004">
                     <placeName>defenceless capital</placeName>
                  </location>, in a country where two soldiers can disperse a mob.</s>
               <s>Her Majesty's 84th was hastily brought up from <location source="1259224">
                     <placeName>Burmah</placeName>
                  </location>.</s>
               <s>A wing of her Majesty's 53rd was ordered to <location source="1277100">
                     <geogName>Barrackpore</geogName>
                  </location>.</s>
               <s>The native body guard (cavalry), 500 strong, were dispatched in the night, and two
                  troops of artillery, with twelve pieces of cannon, were brought form <location
                     source="10510004">
                     <placeName>Dumdum</placeName>
                  </location> into the cantonment.</s>
               <s>Private orders were issued to the magistrates to place large bodies of the police
                  upon the bridges which lead into the town.</s>
               <s>Finally, orders were issued to Major-General Hearsey, authorising him to suppress
                  resistance, even if it were necessary to employ the whole force at his disposal,
                  and to destroy three regiments.</s>
               <s>The Europeans waited with a sort of anxious nonchalance for the result, such as
                  Anglo-Indians can alone display, and amused themselves by circulating the most
                  preposterous rumours.</s>
               <s>These measures were complete on March 30.</s>
               <s>Meanwhile a number of circumstances increased the prevailing uneasiness.</s>
               <s>The Colonel commanding at <location source="10510004">
                     <placeName>Dumdum</placeName>
                  </location> received what appeared to be trustworthy intelligence that the 19th
                  were marching on the station to seize the artillery.</s>
               <s><location source="10510004">
                     <placeName>Dumdum</placeName>
                  </location> is eight miles from Calcutta.</s>
               <s>He had only thirty men, but he called them together, prepared for defence, and
                  ordered all officers' families to quit the station.</s>
               <s>They obeyed, and at two o'clock at night some doen frightened women were besieging
                  the houses of their friends in Calcutta for rest and shelter.</s>
               <s>The same afternoon Lieutenant Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th Native Infantry, was
                  attacked by a drunken or drugged sepoy at <location source="1277100">
                     <placeName>Barrackpore</placeName>
                  </location>.</s>
               <s>He was severely wounded, but the guard refused to arrest the assassin, and the man
                  strutted up and down till he was seized by the Major-General himself.</s>
               <s>The transaction looked as if the regiments were resolved to die rather than
                  yield.</s>
               <s>On the following morning the Europeans were landed, and marched to the parade.</s>
               <s>The two Queen's regiments, with the artillery and cavalry, occupied one side, the
                  native regiments the other, and the 19th Natie Infantry, which had been halted for
                  the night outside the station, marched into the midst.</s>
               <s>The Major-General then read aloud the order.</s></p>
            <p><s>Up to the last moment it was doubtful whether the men would submit, or whether a
                  yell of defiance would compel General Hearsey to open fire.</s>
               <s>They asked permission to petition.</s>
               <s>The time, they were told, had passed, and they must lay down their arms.</s>
               <s>The preparations cowed the men.</s>
               <s>The old instinctive terror of the Europeans has not passed away, and they laid
                  down their arms, the native officers actually weeping with grief and rage.</s>
               <s>No humiliation was offered them, and they were allowed to retain their uniforms,
                  and were then escorted by the cavalry to <location source="1273919"><placeName>Chinsurah</placeName></location>.</s>
               <s>Thence they are gradually dispersing to their homes.</s></p>
            <p><s>It was believed that this example would have had a profound effect.</s>
               <s>It has certainly confirmed the wavering, but the 34th are more mutinous than
                  ever.</s>
               <s>The man who attempted to assassinate Lieutenant Baugh was condemned to death; but
                  so dangerous was the temper of the men that General Hearsey could not venture to
                  trust them, and the sentence was carried out under the protection of shotted guns
                  and two European regiments.</s>
               <s>It may be necessary to mention that this General is a thoroughly able, gallant
                  officer, one of the few Hindostanee scholars in his rank, and generally speaking,
                  beloved by the sepoys.</s></p>
            <p><s>I fear the 34th also must be disbanded.</s>
               <s>Meanwhile the native regiment at <location source="1273581"><placeName>Dinapore</placeName></location> is only kept in check by the presence of
                  her Majesty's 10th.</s>
               <s>The selected soldiers at the Umballa and Sealkott rifle-schools complain that they
                  shall be outcasts if they use the cartridge; and the Commander-in-Chief's own
                  escort have excommunicated their comrades for touching them.</s>
               <s>Almost all the regiments of the line sypathise more or less; but, strange to say,
                  all the Irregulars, all the Sikhs, the Goonkas, and all the cavalry ridicule the
                  movement.</s>
               <s>The Sikhs in the ranks of the 34th are actually leaving the regiment in utter
                  disgust.</s>
               <s>The fact, if the affair become more serious, is very important.</s>
               <s>I think, as a matter of opinion, that it must end in blood somwhere, but I have no
                  fear of a general revolt.</s>
               <s>One source of danger is the extreme exasperation of the Europeans.</s>
               <s>A mutiny doubles their duties, and it is not always quite easy to hold them
                  in.</s></p>
